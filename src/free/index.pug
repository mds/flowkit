          h1 Free Trial?
          p.fk-intro ðŸ˜¢ Sadly, there is no free version to try. I've thought about this a lot and even attempted to create a few files that would be free-trial worthy, but in the end couldn't come up with a proper solution.

          p The big problem with this is, if I were to have a file that only contained a few pieces to play around with, you wouldn't really get the full experience of using Flowkit and that would have a negative and effect on your perceived value of the product itself.

          p And I can't really just send the entire file to try out, because that would be essentially giving it away for free, since there's no way to <strong>take back</strong> a digital file.

          p You can <a href="/preview">preview all of the files here</a> and essentially look under the hood to see everything that's included, you just can't actually them.

          p I can say that if you are curious to try it out, then go ahead and buy it. It has saved me tons of time creating flows and I have a ton of testimonials of other customers who concur.

          p If you decide to <a href="/#buy">buy Flowkit</a> and just don't like itâ€”let me knowâ€”and I will be happy to give you a 100% refund for your purchase.
